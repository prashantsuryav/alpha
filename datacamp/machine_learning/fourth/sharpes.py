# We need to find the "ideal" portfolios for each date so we can use them as targets for machine learning.
# We'll loop through each date in portfolio_returns, then loop through the portfolios we generated with
# portfolio_returns[date]. We'll then calculate the Sharpe ratio, which is the return divided by volatility
# (assuming a no-risk return of 0).
# We use enumerate() to loop through the returns for the current date (portfolio_returns[date]) and keep
# track of the index with i. Then we use the current date and current index to get the volatility of each portfolio with
# portfolio_volatility[date][i]. Finally, we get the index of the best Sharpe ratio for each date using np.argmax().
# We'll use this index to get the ideal portfolio weights soon.
